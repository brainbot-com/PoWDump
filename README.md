# PoWDump

PoWDump is the prime venue for the Ethereum community to dump their PoW ETH, sunset the PoW chain faster, and save
the environment without having to go via a centralized exchange!

We are proponents of the Proof-of-Stake Ethereum, and we can’t wait for The Merge to happen. Still, we must deal with
the reality that there will be a Proof-of-Work fork. This leads to sort of an “airdrop” situation for ETH holders. Due
to the fork, they'll receive PoW ETH, which they probably don’t even want to hold.

PoWDump is a simple DApp that lets PoW ETH sellers create atomic cross-chain swaps which match them with buyers. This
makes it a secure, on-chain way to sell your PoW ETH, which doesn’t rely on centralized exchanges or trusted (wrapped)
bridges.
